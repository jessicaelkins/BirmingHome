# BirmingHome

## Description
BirmingHome is a home service website similar to NextDoor where you post requests for household jobs that you need help with. You have to create a profile to post jobs and to see other posts and user profiles. You can filter posts by location or by job type. You can edit your profile to update your phone number, profile picture, or about me. You can view other userâ€™s profiles when they post a job request so that you can get their contact info.
